## ====== fix images generated by GIMP

## move customized images into own directory
# mkdir active && cp *-active.xpm active/
# cd active

## Find and replace the color definition headers in images
## Note: Verify the charecters are the same in each, as GIMP will reassign them. Change the 2nd to match the first
	## FIND: (in plain text)
