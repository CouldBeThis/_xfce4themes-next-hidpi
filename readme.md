# variation of `next` from `xfce4themes` - hiDPI version 
version 1.0

## Features

- Window decoration buttons for active, inactive, prelight (hover) and pressed (clicking). 
- GTK theme color pickup --- it will use the colors specified in`xfce4-appearance-settings`; not pink if you don't like. 

## Requirements

1. This theme was designed for [Xfce Desktop Environment](https://xfce.org/) on linux. Possibly other combinations can make use of it. 
2. It has been modified with a HiDPI monitor in mind and will look terrible on displays set up otherwise. 

## Installation

Put the directory into your user or system theme directory. You will be able to select this theme in the `Window manager` settings dialogue (`xfwm4-settings`).

## Credits

- the `next` xfwm theme is from the `xfwm4-themes` collection which is available on various repos. Upstream was [Distrotech/xfwm4-themes](https://github.com/Distrotech/xfwm4-themes); it is a mirror of a repo that no longer exists, though it is [archived](https://git.xfce.org/archive/xfwm4-themes). Some [discussion](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1184207/where-can-i-get-xfwm4-themes-on-xubuntu-19-10) of this.
  - I forked the full collection to [CouldBeThis/xfwm4-themes](https://github.com/CouldBeThis/xfwm4-themes). You can find the parent at [xfwm4-themes/themes/next at master](https://github.com/CouldBeThis/xfwm4-themes/tree/master/themes/next)
